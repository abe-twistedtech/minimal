### Lending Club Case Study

If one is able to identify risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.In other words, understanding the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.

## Machine Learning 1 (ML1)

### Bike Sharing Case Study

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. This assigment builds a multiple linear regression model that helps predict demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.It can be used to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.
