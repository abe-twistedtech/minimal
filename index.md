## Statistics and Exploratory Data Analyics (EDA)

### Lending Club Case Study

This risk analytic assignment involved solving a case study to gain an understanding of how real business problems are addressed using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It aimed to provide insights into risk analytics in the banking and financial services domain, demonstrating how data can be leveraged to minimize the risk of financial losses in lending.

The primary focus was to identify loan applicants who posed a higher risk of default, as such applicants are the primary contributors to credit loss. 

The objective was to analyze the data and determine the key driving factors (or driver variables) that indicated a higher likelihood of loan default. Understanding these variables and their significance  would enable the company to reduce risky loans and mitigate credit loss. The insights gained could be utilized for effective portfolio management and risk assessment.

## Machine Learning 1 (ML2)

### Telecom Churn Study

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. 

In this project, we analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn. The goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.

## Deep Learning (DL)

### Melanoma Detection Assignment

In this assignment, the focus was on addressing melanoma, a type of cancer responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths and potentially fatal if not detected early. The objective was to create a solution or model capable of evaluating medical images to assist dermatologists in identifying the presence of melanoma. By doing so, the model aimed to reduce the significant manual effort involved in diagnosis and improve early detection.

The input dataset consisted of 2,357 images spanning nine malignant and benign oncological disease classes. These images were sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), providing a diverse and reliable dataset for training and evaluation.

To enhance the model's performance, data augmentation techniques were applied to address underfitting, overfitting, and class imbalances in the dataset. This ensured the model's robustness and improved its predictive accuracy.

Through this project,a powerful model was built, applying advanced techniques to tackle a critical real-world problem in the medical field. This hands-on experience not only strengthened technical skills but also showcased the potential of AI in improving healthcare outcomes.

### Gesture Recognition Assignment

In this assignment, the goal was to design a smart-TV feature capable of recognizing five different user gestures to control the TV without a remote. By detecting and interpreting gestures, users could interact with the TV seamlessly, enhancing convenience and accessibility.

To achieve this, videos of gestures were analyzed using neural networks. Two prominent architectures were commonly used for video processing:

* #### CNN + RNN Architectureâ€¨ - 

This approach leveraged the strengths of both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Each frame of the video was passed through a CNN, which extracted a feature vector representing the key information from that image. These feature vectors, representing the entire sequence of frames, were then fed into an RNN to model the temporal dependencies and analyze the sequence as a whole. This method was something you were already familiar with in theory.
 
* #### 3D Convolutional Network Architecture - 

A natural evolution of standard CNNs, 3D Convolutional Networks extended the convolution operation to three dimensions (height, width, and time). This allowed the model to simultaneously capture spatial and temporal features from video data. Unlike the CNN + RNN combination, 3D convolutions directly processed video frames as a block, making it a more unified approach for video-based tasks.
 
In this project, both architectures were explored to build the gesture recognition feature. This hands-on project offered an exciting opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to create an innovative, real-world application.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Identifying Entities in Healthcare Data

The assignment involved developing a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model to extract diseases and their corresponding treatments from a medical text dataset. The task simulated a scenario for a health tech company,  aiming to organize and interpret unstructured medical data generated through online consultations and prescriptions.

The dataset included sentences with implicit mentions of diseases and treatments, requiring the application of a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model to identify and map these entities. Key steps involved processing the data into sentence format, defining features for the CRF model, training the model using the provided training dataset, and evaluating its performance on test data.

Finally, the extracted information was structured into a dictionary where diseases were keys and their probable treatments were values, enabling better data organization and usability for medical applications.

### Automatic Ticket Classification

The assignment involved automating a financial company's customer support ticket system. The goal was to classify unstructured customer complaints into categories based on the company's products and services, enabling faster issue resolution and improved customer satisfaction.

Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) for topic modeling, patterns and recurring words in the complaints were analyzed to identify the key features for each category. The complaints were segregated into five clusters: credit card/prepaid card, bank account services, theft/dispute reporting, mortgages/loans, and others.

The insights gained from topic modeling were then used to train supervised models such as logistic regression or decision trees, enabling the classification of new customer complaints into their relevant categories for efficient handling.
