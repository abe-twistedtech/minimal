### Lending Club Case Study

If one is able to identify risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.In other words, understanding the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.

## Machine Learning 1 (ML1)

### Bike Sharing Case Study

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. This assigment builds a multiple linear regression model that helps predict demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.It can be used to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features.

### Telecom Churn Study

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, we analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn. The goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Melanoma Detection Assignment

In this assignment, the focus was on addressing melanoma, a type of cancer responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths and potentially fatal if not detected early. The objective was to create a solution or model capable of evaluating medical images to assist dermatologists in identifying the presence of melanoma. By doing so, the model aimed to reduce the significant manual effort involved in diagnosis and improve early detection.

The input dataset consisted of 2,357 images spanning nine malignant and benign oncological disease classes. These images were sourced from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC), providing a diverse and reliable dataset for training and evaluation.

To enhance the model's performance, data augmentation techniques were applied to address underfitting, overfitting, and class imbalances in the dataset. This ensured the model's robustness and improved its predictive accuracy.

Through this project, participants built a powerful model, applying advanced techniques to tackle a critical real-world problem in the medical field. This hands-on experience not only strengthened technical skills but also showcased the potential of AI in improving healthcare outcomes.

### Gesture Recognition Assignment

In this assignment, the goal was to design a smart-TV feature capable of recognizing five different user gestures to control the TV without a remote. By detecting and interpreting gestures, users could interact with the TV seamlessly, enhancing convenience and accessibility.

To achieve this, videos of gestures were analyzed using neural networks. Two prominent architectures were commonly used for video processing:

	1	CNN + RNN Architecture This approach leveraged the strengths of both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Each frame of the video was passed through a CNN, which extracted a feature vector representing the key information from that image. These feature vectors, representing the entire sequence of frames, were then fed into an RNN to model the temporal dependencies and analyze the sequence as a whole. This method was something you were already familiar with in theory.
 
	2	3D Convolutional Network Architecture A natural evolution of standard CNNs, 3D Convolutional Networks extended the convolution operation to three dimensions (height, width, and time). This allowed the model to simultaneously capture spatial and temporal features from video data. Unlike the CNN + RNN combination, 3D convolutions directly processed video frames as a block, making it a more unified approach for video-based tasks.
 
In this project, both architectures were explored to build the gesture recognition feature. This hands-on project offered an exciting opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to create an innovative, real-world application.
